-----How to use the Dynamic Clouds-----

1. Place the Clouds prefab in your scene
2. Scale it (uniformly) so it's scale matches the camera's far plane.
3. Assign the Sun's directional light in the Cloud Controller script atteched to the Clouds object 
4. (optional) Adjust the parameters to your liking (see below)

You can look at the SingleCameraScene for a simple demonstration of this setup.

The clouds are physically present in the scene, rendered on a dome. 
Depending on the setup of your scene, you could have issues with objects clipping through the clouds, or semi-tranparent objects being rendered behind the clouds.
If that is the case, you can use a different camera to render the skybox and clouds, which will fix these issues, but can have a slight cost on performance.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Set the Clouds object to a different unused Layer (for example "TransparentFX"), which I'll call the clouds layer from now on
2. Duplicate the camera, which we will use to render the clouds (rename it if you like)
3. Remove the Audio Listener component from the clouds camera (and any other you might have added)
4. Parent the clouds camera to the main camera, and make sure it's transform properties are neutral 
5. Select "nothing" in the clouds camera's Culling Mask, then select the clouds layer (which makes the camera render only this layer)
6. Set the clouds camera's depth to 1 lower than the main camera
7. Set the main camera's clear flags to "Depth only"
8. Deselect the clouds layer in the Culling Mask (which makes the camera not render this layer)

You can look at the MultiCameraScene for a simple demonstration of this setup.


-----Parameters-----

All parameters can be set in the shader, but some are overwritten in the CloudController script

in the CloudController script you can set the following:

- Shadow Factor: How much the clouds dim the sun light: at 0 it will completely block the sun, at 1 the sunlight is unafected
- Wind Speed: Makes the clouds move in the direction of the vector, a value of 1 is incredibly fast, so usually you want something smaller than 0.01
- Update From Shader: When enabled it will update it's own variable based on the shader's each frame. If you're in doubt of wheter you need this, just keep it enabled

In the clouds material you can set the following:
(The other material-parameters should not be altered directly)

- Top Clouds: Amount of cloud-coverage at the zenith (top), 0 is none, 1 is fully clouded (but not necessarily fully-opaque), at 2 it is fully opque (as long as the Thickness is atleast 1)
- Horizon Clouds: Amount of cloud-coverage at the horizon
- Cloud Thickness: The denseness/opqueness of the clouds, the higher the number the more sharply defined the clouds are. 0 is no clouds, 1 is fully soft clouds, >1 is sharper clouds
- Turbulence: the speed at which the clouds move around (without actually altering their shape), generally you'll want this between 0 and 1
- Shape Change Speed: the speed at which the clouds change their shape (without changing the general amount of coverage), realistically this would between 0 and 0.1
- Scale: changes the size of the clouds by scaling (and tiling) the entire effect. (If you keep it above 0.2 it should not produce any visible repeating patterns)
- Cloud Light: the color of the clouds at their lightest
- Cloud Dark: the color of the clouds at their darkest
- Fog Color: the fogcolor on the clouds (best to keep similar to the scene-fogcolor)
- Fog: amount of fog, 0 is (practically) no fog, 1 means full fog at the horizon, no fog at the zenith, and a soft transition inbetween
- Fade amount: makes the clouds fade out near the horizon, works the same as the fog

Appart from the Turbulence, Shape Change Speed and Scale, all of these parameters can be altered at runtime for a fully dynamic sky.


-----Animating the clouds-----

The CloudsAnimator script is a simple script that shows how you can make the clouds change over time, by making it alternate between 2 states.
You're free to use this and alter it, or make your own scripts to make the clouds behave as you want.
